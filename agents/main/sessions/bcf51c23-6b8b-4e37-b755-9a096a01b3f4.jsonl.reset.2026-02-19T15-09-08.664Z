The user is asking about their XRP holdings using the coinbase-advanced-trader skill. First, I need to check if I have access to their Coinbase account or if I need to use the Coinbase API. Since the skill is called coinbase-advanced-trader, it probably uses the official Python SDK.\n\nWait, the tools available include the coinbase-advanced-trader skill, which uses the RESTClient SDK. So I should call that skill. But how? The user didn't log in, so maybe the skill requires authentication. But in the tools, the functions are listed, so maybe the skill is already set up to handle the user's credentials.\n\nWait, the user might have already authenticated with Coinbase through the skill. The skill's description says it's for executing trades via the official SDK with guardrails. So, to check holdings, the skill should have a function to get the user's assets.\n\nBut how does the skill interact with the user's account? Maybe the skill is already initialized with the user's credentials. So, the correct approach is to use the coinbase-advanced-trader skill's functionality to fetch the XRP balance.\n\nWait, but the available functions listed in the tools don't include a direct way to get holdings. The functions are read, write, edit, exec, etc. So maybe the skill needs to be used to run a command that fetches the balance.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the skill has a function called something like 'get_holding' or 'get_balance'. But since the tools are predefined, perhaps the user needs to use the web_search or web_fetch functions to find the balance. But that's not efficient.\n\nWait, the user is using the coinbase-advanced-trader skill, which is supposed to handle advanced trade execution. So the skill might have a function to get the user's holdings. But how to trigger that function?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user needs to use the exec function to run a command via the Coinbase SDK. But without knowing the exact command, it's tricky. The skill's SKILL.md might have the necessary functions, but since I can't read it unless the task matches, I need to check.\n\nThe user's query is about checking XRP holdings, so the skill-coinbase-advanced-trader should be the right one. But how to call it? Maybe the function is part of the skill's internal tools. Since the user mentioned the skill's name, I should use the skill's functions.\n\nBut the tools available are the ones listed in the functions above. So perhaps the correct approach is to use the web_search function to find the user's XRP balance. But that's not secure. Alternatively, maybe the skill has a function to get the balance, which I can call through the exec function.\n\nWait, the tools include the exec function, which can run shell commands. If the skill is set up to use the Coinbase SDK, maybe the user can run a command like 'cb_get_balance XRP' via exec. But without knowing the exact command, it's hard to proceed.\n\nAlternatively, the skill might have a function called 'get_holding' that takes the asset symbol as an argument.
