Continue with feature engineering steps such as adding technical indicators.\n2. Split dataset into training and testing sets.\n3. Train Random Forest model on the training data.\n4. Evaluate the model using the testing set.\n\n## Critical Context\n- Path to collected stock price DataFrame: /data/stock_prices.csv\n- Example code for Yahoo Finance API usage:\n  ```python\n  import yfinance as yf\n  data = yf.download('AAPL', start='2015-01-01')\n  ```\n- Documentation on Yahoo Finance API: <https://pypi.org/project/yfinance/>","firstKeptEntryId":"89984fcd","tokensBefore":10412,"details":{"readFiles":[],"modifiedFiles":[]},"fromHook":false}
